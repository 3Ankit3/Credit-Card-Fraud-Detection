# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection using Machine Learning

### Overview:
This project tackles the problem of credit card fraud detection using machine learning techniques. Fraudulent transactions are extremely rare (0.17% of the dataset), making this a highly imbalanced classification problem.

We explore both oversampling (SMOTE) and undersampling strategies to handle imbalance, and train multiple models to determine the best performer.
